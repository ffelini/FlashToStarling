# FlashToStarling
A Flash to Starling runtime converter. This is an starling framework 1.7 extension that parses the given classical flash display list hierarchy and tries to mimic the same in starling. The result should be pretty much the same hierarchy but depends on the setup. The project is written in HAXE and is for Starling Framework 1.7.
